# Vulbytes Theme
<br /> 
this is a theme made for [better discord](https://betterdiscord.app/), 
<br /> 

i made this theme because i wanted a modern feeling ui skin for discord that is heighter contrast, and overall jsut makes the ui feel a lot less annoying.
<br /> 

this is obviously personal preference but i just don't really like the other so bleh
<br /> 


## requriements 

- better discord: [better discord](https://betterdiscord.app/) <br /> 
- Geist font: [Geist font by vercel](https://vercel.com/font) <br />
this is a really nice font put out by vercel under a publically usable license, and it's a really nice fon't. not perfect, but really good expecally for a modern setting. <br />
this is honestly probably the biggest breath of fresh fair given to the whole ui. <br />
- an internet conenction: [the internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet)<br /> 
- a computer with at least an i3-1000 (i have not tested this claim): [consider a computer here (put linux on it)](https://www.dellrefurbished.ca/)((this is not an endorcement for dell, honestly i would avoid them unless the one you get is an amazing price for what you're getting or you have a very very specific reason for doing so. rly dell is honestly my last choice for a pc. buy a framework or something instead lol)) <br />
